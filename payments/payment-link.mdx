Customers today want payments to be quick, easy, and safe. If it's not, you might lose them when they're trying to pay. Whether you're building your own payment process or just want a simple link to get paid, our Payment Link APIs can help you do just that.

Payment checkouts let you design your own smooth and branded payment experience right in your app or website. Payment links, on the other hand, are a fast way to get customer info and start payments. They are easy to make, simple to share, and can be used in many places: on your website, on your social media page, or even in an invoice or email.

This part will show you how to use both of these tools. You'll learn how to start collecting payments faster and in a smarter way â€“ with less work and better results.

## Understanding Payment Links
When a customer opens a payment link, they are presented with a form to enter their personal information like their name, email address and the amount, currency. Their input is validated, and they are redirected to the checkout interface.

Customers can use these links to pay once, or they can set up payments that happen regularly. These regular payments can keep going until you stop them, or they can happen regularly for a specific number of times.
